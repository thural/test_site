      <h1>Internal Combustion Engines</h1>	

      <p id="the_first_parag">
        Internal combustin engines turns the energy of specific gasses into mechanical 
        energy by burning them in the process. Below you can see the engine of Opel Vectra B 
        with 1598 cc displacement named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_Family_1_engine#Ecotec">X16XEL</a> 
        (optimized for low-end torque)

      <p>
        There are wide range of IC Engines types. Some of them are listed below:
      </p>

      <ul>

	        <strong>
	
            <li>Turbocharged</li>
            <li>Naturally Aspirated</li>
            <li>Supercharged</li>
            <li>Procharged</li>
            <li>Electrocharged</li>
            <li>NO2 charged</li>
    
     		  </strong>
    
    	</ul>
    
      <p>The different engine types listed above by their induction methodes. 
        Turbocharged and Naturally aspirated engines are the most popular and widely used. Lets expalin both of them;
      </p>

      <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharged_petrol_engines">Turbocharged</a></h2>
    
      <p>Turbocharged engines are aspirated by specific turbines which consists of 2 turbine blades which are spining at thousands of RPM 
        using exhaust gas pressure and forcing clean air into the combustion chambers at higher than atmospheric pressure around 1-4 Bars.

	    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine">Naturally Aspirated</a></h3>
    
      <p>Natually Aspirated engines are apirated using atmospheric pressure of the natural environment. 
        Moving pistons dragging air through an intake manifold into combustion chamber at intake stroke.
