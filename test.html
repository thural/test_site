        Internal combustin engines converts energy of specific gasses into mechanical energy by burning them 
        in the process. Below you can see a tuned engine of Opel Vectra B with 1598 cc displacement named 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_Family_1_engine#Ecotec">X16XEL</a> (optimized low-end torque)
      </p>

        There are wide range of IC Engines types. Some of them are listed below:
      </p>

      <ul>

	        <strong>
	
            <li><a href="#turbo">Turbocharged</a></li>
            <li>Naturally Aspirated</li>
            <li>Supercharged</li>
            <li>Procharged</li>
            <li>Electrocharged</li>
            <li>NO2 charged</li>
    
     		  </strong>
    
    	</ul>
    
      <p>The different engine types listed above are categorized by their induction methodes. 
        Turbocharged and Naturally aspirated engines are the most popular and widely used. Lets expalin both of them;
      </p>
      

      <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine">Naturally Aspirated</a></h3>

      <p>Natually Aspirated engines apirated using atmospheric pressure of natural environment. 
        Moving pistons dragging air through an intake manifold into combustion chamber at intake stroke.

      <h2 id="turbo"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharged_petrol_engines">Turbocharged</a></h2>
    
      <p>Turbocharged engines aspirated using specific turbines attached in serial to <bold>intake manifold</bold>. 
        Turbochargers consists of 2 turbine blades one is the compressor blade the other is the turbine blade 
        which are spining at thousands of RPMs by the force of exhaust gasses flowing through turbine blade.
